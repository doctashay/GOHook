# GOHook
 An old high school project built for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive using the Source SDK. 

 I built this program in 2016 to further understand concepts related to memory management as well as assembly language

 I've posted this in the hopes someone may find it helpful.

 Currently does not compile on AMD processors due to Intel specific intrinsic functions. 
 
 No further plans for updates at the moment.
